- First of all, R is a programming language for statistical and data analysis.

- **Open** source $\rightarrow$ anyone can contribute
- **Use**: 
    - **Base R**: functions that R understands without any further instructions
    - **Packages**: think of them as new tricks that you can teach your R
- More than anything else, R follows instructions, so we need to learn how to give them

### Installing R and R Studio

- Download & Install the newest `r version$version.string` at [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
- Download and install R Studio at [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

### R Studio

- R as a language can be used on its own - but that's no fun.

![R GUI on its own](./img/RGUI.png){#id .class width=auto height=260px}

- That's why we use R Studio as a user interface to run R.
- Think of it as dipping your fingers in a pot of ink to write versus using a pen and paper - you will still write with the same ink, but the whole process is just nicer. <i class="fa-solid fa-feather-pointed" style="color: darkgray;"></i>

### R Studio Layout

![R Studio - typical layout](./img/rstudio.png){#id .class width=auto height=560px}

### Workflow


- Instructions or *commands* through the **Console** (bottom left tile) or in a Script in the **Editor** (top left tile).
  
-   **Console**: quickly try a command, install a package or to gather information about things like your working directory (we'll get to that later)
    - These are things that we do maybe once per session but usually don't need to reproduce.
-   **Editor**: pretty much everything else
    - Create ***Scripts*** where we can save all the code that we write to use and find again


### New Script

- For most things - especially during the learning phase - it makes sense to write a Script in the Editor in order to be able to save and access the work.
- To do so, simply click the !["New Script" button](./img/newfile.png){#id .class .no-border width=auto height=36px} button and choose 'R Script'.

## Basics 

```{r basicbasics}
1+2
2-3
3*4
4/3
```

### Advanced Math

```{r basicbasics2}
5^2 # power
sqrt(64) # square root
sum(1, 2, 3) # sum
pi # constant
```
                                                                                                                                                         
    
### Assigning Variables

```{r basicbasics3}
a <- 3
b <- 4
a*b+5
```

- R can be used as a calculator to perform basic & advanced math
- Variables that contain numbers (such as `a & b`) can be used in their place in a calculation

### Variables



- `a & b` only contain numbers $\rightarrow$ called **numeric**
    - check this property of a variable, e.g. `a` using the function `class(a)`, which gives us "`r class(a)`" as output
    
- Usually we don't just want to work with single values but with **data frames** or **vectors** ![Vector](./img/vector.png){#id .class .no-border width=auto height=40px} 
    - can contain different classes of variables and several values
    

### Vectors

```{r advancedbasics}
c <- c(6, 7, 8)
class(c)
d <- c("sunny", "rainy", "foggy")
class(d)
```

- Notice that we did not just add all values one after the other, but followed a certain notation that begins with the function `c()` $\rightarrow$ _combine_ or _concatenate_

### Data Frames

```{r advancedbasics2}
e <- data.frame(c,d)
class(e)
```

- There are several ways of adding variables to a data frame, but the `data.frame()` command is the simplest. 

<i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb" style="color: purple;"></i>
<i style="color: purple;"> All values in a variable should have the same class. 
Go ahead and try out `hm <- c(3, "sunny", 5.2)` and check the class. 
What happened - did you expect that?</i>

![Happy T-Rex](./img/trex.png){#id .class width=auto height=400px}

## Working with Data Frames

```{r e-df}
e
```

- We usually want to access either certain **rows** or **columns** from data frames
- Base R uses square brackets `[]`: "take this data, but only certain rows/columns/cells"
- Remember: The brackets understand the first input as rows and the second as columns - _rows right away_ 
    - German: Zuerst Zeilen, Später Spalten

### Square Brackets

```{r brackets}
e[1, ] # first row
e[ , 1] # first column

weather <- e[ , 2]; weather

e[1, 1]*e[2, 1] # certain cells
```

### Data Sets in Base R


- Data set `e` contains three numbers in column c and different strings in column d
- Any row, column or cell can be selected
- Values can also be re-assigned
    - e.g. to a new variable named "weather" 
- Calculations can be performed on single cells in the data frame (only if they contain numerics)


### Square Brackets

<br>

<i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb" style="color: purple;"></i>
<i style="color: purple;">
With square brackets we can only index rows and columns that are present in the data.
That maybe sounds obvious, but can easily lead to confusion because of error messages! <br>
What happens when you try to index `e[,3]`?
</i>

### Brainteaser <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb" style="color: yellow;"></i>

<br>

Use the data frame `e` that we have created.

1. With the square bracket indexing you can also use a variable name in quotes to index the right column. \
Create vector that contains the second row from column "c" and the third row from column "d".

2. What is the first row of column one to the power of the third row of column one?

### Solution: 1

<br>

Creating a new vector from certain columns in e

```{r}
newvector <- c(e[2, "c"], e[3, "d"])
newvector
```

### Solution: 2

First row of column one to the power of the third row of column one in data set e

```{r}
e[1, 1]^e[3, 1]
```

### Base R vs. Packages

<br>


- Base R is important to learn, you can do anything in base R
    - Anything you can do in R without loading anything is base R
    - E.g. [ ], the c()-function, sqrt()-function...

- Using packages is just more intuitive and fun, usually


## Installing Packages 

![Hexagon Package logos](./img/hexagons.png)

<br>

- Most packages are available on CRAN - the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
- Easily install the package you wantwith the command \
`install.packages("packagename")`
- Important: Package name must be in quotes for the installation
    - Loading it into a script works without quotes using `library(packagename)`
    
### Tidyverse


- Packages usually serve quite specific purposes, e.g.
    - `dplyr`: makes data handling easier and more intuitive 
    - `ggplot2`, which allows us to create beautiful, publication-ready plots and visualizations
- `tidyverse`: "meta package" which automatically loads those two and several other packages 
    - Makes the functions from those many different packages available at once
    - Quite convenient when we want to use a lot of those packages in the same session or script
    - Also takes a lot longer to load (sometimes not actually necessary)
    
    
### Using the `tidyverse`

<br> 

- Please install the `tidyverse`, using \
`install.packages("tidyverse")` **in the console **
- Then load it **into your script** with \
`library(tidyverse)`
- Test whether it works by typing \
`iris %>% pull(Sepal.Length) %>% mean()` 

### Explanation
#### `iris %>% pull(Sepal.Length) %>% mean()` 

- $\rightarrow$ This line of code takes the data set `iris` (included in R by default)
    - "pulls" the variable `Sepal.Length` out of the data and 
    - runs the `mean()` function on it, to calculate the average sepal length, 
    - should be `r iris %>% pull(Sepal.Length) %>% mean()`.
    
### Exercise

Using a package can be made explicit by typing `packagename::functionname()`. \
Accessing "Help" pages is done by typing "?functionname" or "?packagename::functionname()".



- <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb" style="color: yellow;"></i> Find Help on the function `select()` from the package `dplyr`
    - What does it do?
- Try selecting only the "Species" Variable inside the "iris" data set (it is basically in your environment even if it is not explicitly shown)
    - What are the species called?
    - How many different species are there?
    - What would you need to make the output clearer?


### Solution



- The "select" function works similar to the square brackets, but it makes it a little more intuitive
    - You can select a variable by name or position in the data frame
    - You cannot select rows, only columns i.e. variables
- Selecting the Species variable from iris data works with `select(iris, Species)` and outputs the variable as a one-column-dataframe
    - The species are called _setosa, versicolor & virginica_
    - There are 3 _unique_ species in the data set
    - You can use the function `unique()` like so: `unique(select(iris, Species))`
