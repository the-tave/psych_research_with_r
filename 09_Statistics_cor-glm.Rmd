In this chapter we will look into the correlation and linear regression model in R. 

I will assume that you have a basic understanding of what all statistics mentioned in this book are, as they are commonly used among psychologists. 
However, let's start with a brief statistics re-cap to be on the same page. <i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap" style="color: darkred;"></i>

Both the correlation - usually reported with Pearson's _r_ coefficient -  and the regression - also known as (general) linear model - give us measures of **association**. 
The association can be positive (the larger x, the larger y) or negative (the larger x, the smaller y), which is reflected by the sign of the coefficient: _r = 1_ would be a perfect positive correlation and _r = -1_ would be a perfect negative correlation.

Hopefully, you have heard this one thousand times already, so let me tell you for the thousand and first time: **Correlation does not imply causation**.
The correlation coefficient r only tells us about the direction and strength of the association and nothing about the causal relation.
However, in the regression model we can check whether Y changes on the basis of X, so we can include assumptions of cause and effect in our model^[A linear model that is ill-defined might still become significant and thus misleading, so your modeling decisions should always be made with a theoretical basis.]

    
```{r tree-age, fig.height=2.5, echo = F, fig.cap = "Age and circumference of orange trees shown in a scatterplot. We can see that there seems to be a positive relationship between the two measures: The older the tree, the larger the circumference."}
ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, y = circumference, color = age)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Tree Age", y = "Trunk Circumference") +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = 7) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Correlation

The pearson correlation coefficient _r_ measures **association between two numeric variables**.
The variables need to 

- be _continuous_ & interval-scaled
- be _normally distributed_ & should have _no outliers_
- have a _linear relationship_.
    
Its range is from -1 to 1 which would mean a perfect negative or positive association, respectively.
The closer _r_ is to 0, the weaker the correlation.

Since there will usually be some variation and noise in the data, I believe it makes sense to get a feeling for what different associations might look like.
So, you can play a game of "guess the correlation": Look at the four plots below and guess for each how strong the correlation could be be!
Remember - a **positive** correlation means "**the more X, the more Y**" and a **negative** correlation means "**the more X, the less Y**".
    
### Guess the correlation!

```{r corr1, echo = F, fig.height=3}
r1 <- .3
data1 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n=100, mu=c(0, 0), Sigma=matrix(c(1, r1, r1, 1), nrow=2), empirical=TRUE)
p1 <- ggplot() + geom_jitter(aes(data1[, 1], data1[, 2])) + labs(title = "1") + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text  = element_blank())

r2 <- -.2
data2 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n=100, mu=c(0, 0), Sigma=matrix(c(1, r2, r2, 1), nrow=2), empirical=TRUE)
p2 <- ggplot() + geom_jitter(aes(data2[, 1], data2[, 2])) + labs(title = "2") + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text  = element_blank())

r3 <- .8
data3 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n=100, mu=c(0, 0), Sigma=matrix(c(1, r3, r3, 1), nrow=2), empirical=TRUE)
p3 <- ggplot() + geom_jitter(aes(data3[, 1], data3[, 2])) + labs(title = "3") + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text  = element_blank())

r4 <- -.75
data4 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n=100, mu=c(0, 0), Sigma=matrix(c(1, r4, r4, 1), nrow=2), empirical=TRUE)
p4 <- ggplot() + geom_jitter(aes(data4[, 1], data4[, 2])) + labs(title = "4") + theme_minimal()  + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text  = element_blank())

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2)
```

`r hide()`

r1 = `r r1`, r2 = `r r2`, r3 = `r r3`, r4 = `r r4`

`r unhide()`


## Correlation in R

- Two main functions:
    - `cor()` calculates the correlation
    - `cor.test()` calculates correlation and significance
- As input they both need only an x and a y variable
    - You can specify some other aspects of the calculation, such as statistical method (e.g. "spearman") or how to deal with missing data
    
    
```{r corr2}
x <- 1:10 
y <- sample(x, 10)
cor(x, y)
cor.test(x, y)
```

### Handling missing data

- Many functions have an option for missing data or `NA`s
    - You can often add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to a function for "NA remove"
- In the `cor()` function, we define to only use complete observations
- 
  ```{r}
  k <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  m <- c(1, 3, 2, 5, NA) # same length but 1 data point is missing
  cor(k, m)
  ```
 
- With `use = "complete.obs"` we define to only use pairs of observations that are not missing
-
  ```{r}
  cor(k, m, use = "complete.obs")
  ```
  
-
  ```{r}
  cor(k[1:4], m[1:4])
  ```

### Exercise

Is technology skill associated with seminar motivation? <i class="fa-solid fa-computer" style="color: #ff6600;"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-child-reaching" style="color: #ff6600;"></i>

<br> 

Calculate a correlation test using `cor.test()` to analyze the question.

Try to formulate an interpretation as you would report it in a thesis or paper!

`r hide()`

```{r cor9}
cor.test(seminar$v05_skill_tech, seminar$v10_motivation)
```

"With r = `r round(cor(seminar$v05_skill_tech, seminar$v10_motivation), 3)` there is a positive association of moderate strength between previous technological skill and motivation for the seminaR. This association is not significant (p = `r round(cor.test(seminar$v05_skill_tech, seminar$v10_motivation)$p.value, 3)`), likely due to the small sample size."

`r unhide()`

### Quiz

Look at our seminar dataset by entering `str(seminar)` in the console. 
Which of these correlations would work?
Choose "TRUE" if you think the correlation would work and "FALSE" if you think it would not. 
You can look at the explanation for those that would not work below!

1. `cor(seminar$v02_age, seminar$v04_bodyheight` `r torf(FALSE)`
2. `cor(seminar$v02_age, seminar$v08_loudness)` `r torf(TRUE)`
3. `cor(seminar$v08_loudness, seminar$v06_loc)` `r torf(FALSE)`
    
`r hide("Explanation")`

1. There is a closing bracket missing
2. The variable _v06_loc_ has numbers, but they are recognized as characters!

`r unhide()`
    



## Linear Regression

- Linear regression also works on numerical, normally distributed data
- We assume an association, and regression can help to look for causation
    - There is one **dependent variable** y and one **independent variable** x
    - In multiple linear regression, there can be several x
- Formula: $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta x + \epsilon $$
- What we are essentially doing is building a model for our data and checking how well it actually fits!


### Build the model

- The R function for regression analysis is `lm()` for _linear model_
- It needs a "formula" as input - similar to the formula in the `t.test()`, we need the ~
    - Read Y ~ X as "Y on the basis of/ given X"
    - Our dependent variable Y goes first and our independent variable(s) go after the ~
- If the variables come from a data set, we need to specify data as well

### Visual Inspection

```{r tree-age-elaborate, fig.height=2.5, fig.cap="Scatterplot of orange tree age and cirumference from before with the regression line added. Notice that the variable which is used as the independent X (age) is plotted on the X axis for intuitive reading of the plot."}
ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, y = circumference, color = age)) + geom_jitter(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="lightgray", 
              linewidth = .7, formula = y ~ x) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Tree Age", y = "Trunk Circumference", title = "Do trees get thicker with age?") + 
  scale_color_distiller(palette = 7) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

What could be problematic here? `r mcq(c("homoscedasticity", "multicollinearity", answer = "heteroscadasticity", "oranges"))`

### Build the model
#### Do trees get thicker with age?

```{r treelm}
Treelm <- lm(formula = circumference ~ age, data = Orange)
Treelm
```
  

- The lm alone gives us the mathematical formula
- To look at the statistical results, we need to use another function such as `print()` or `summary()`

### Analyze the model

```{r treelm-2}
summary(Treelm)
```

- Interpretation?
    - Trees get larger circumferences the older they are, but this might be modulated by their Species, environment or other factors

### Exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-hourglass-half"  style="color: #dcdcdc;"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"  style="color: #dcdcdc;"></i>

<br>

Does the age of a person have an influence on how long they took to complete the seminar survey (session length)?

<br>

Use the `lm()` function and report the significance level of the predictor as well as the model equation.

`r hide("Solution (code)")`

```{r age-sess1}
age_sess <- lm(session_length ~ v02_age, data = seminar)
summary(age_sess)
```

`r unhide()`

<br>

`r hide("Solution (interpretation)")`

"The age of a person does not significantly predict the time it took them to complete the survey (p = .148). The model equation is 182.7 -4.19X with age explaining about 18% of the variance in session length for the survey."

```{r age-sess-viz, fig.height=3, echo = F}
ggplot(seminar, aes(x = v02_age, y = session_length)) +
 geom_point(size = 3) +
 geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="lightgray", linewidth = .7, formula = y ~ x) +
 theme_minimal()
```

`r unhide()`

### A word to the wise

- There is also a function called `glm()` for general linear model
- In the cases I showed you, both perform the same tasks
- The `glm()` can also handle other more advanced statistical analyses, including logistic regression
- However, the `lm()` function will output the coefficient of determination $R^2$
    - It tell us the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s)
    - We _could_ also calculate it by hand using the `cor()` function and squaring the result





<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- model <- data.frame(age = Orange$age, -->
<!--                     circ = (17.3997 + Orange$age * 0.107)) -->
<!-- ggplot(model, aes(x = age, y = circ, color = age)) + -->
<!--   geom_jitter(size = 3) + -->
<!--   geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="lightgray", linewidth = .7, formula = y ~ x) + -->
