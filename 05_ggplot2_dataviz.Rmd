As you may have gathered by now, I strongly believe that learning (R) should be fun in order to motivate people to keep going.
I also strongly believe that being able to literally look at your data is immensely helpful in understanding the type of statistics you can calculate with it, what the distribution looks like and what generally we are dealing with.
Therefore, we will learn how to make our data visible to both us and others and get to know `ggplot2` as powerful data visualization package from the `tidyverse`

## Data Visalization <i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line" style="color: darkred;"></i>

Data Visualization or data viz for short is an important part of reporting any data in any context.
Drawing a pirate map where X marks the spot could be data visualization as well as a professional statistic of political vote tallies in bar plots.
In general, humans are very visual creatures, so readers/ listeners can follow along more when there is something to look at that illustrates the point.



```{r flametrees, echo = F, fig.height=3}
library(flametree)
ft <- flametree_grow(
  seed = 1, 
  time = 9, 
  angle = c(-15, 15, 30)
) 

# ft |> 
#   flametree_plot(
#     background = "white", 
#     palette = c("black", "#f652a0")
#   )

cowplot::plot_grid(ft |> 
  flametree_plot(
    background = "white", 
    palette = c("black", "#f652a0")
  ),
  ft |> 
  flametree_plot(
    background = "white", 
    palette = usecol(c(Seegruen, "lightgray", Pinky), n = 10)
  ),
  ft |> 
  flametree_plot(
    background = "white", 
    palette = usecol(c(Bordeaux, "lightgray", Petrol), n = 10)
  ),
  nrow = 1)
```

The type of visualization to choose strongly depends on what we want to accomplish, who the audience is and of course on the general setting.
While the so-called _flametrees_ above are nice to look at, the don't tell us too much about any data as-is.
With reporting statistics, however, we want to be able to _see_ our data `r paste("¯\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯")`. 
Having a visual representation can be helpful in understanding relationships between variables which helps us and consumers to interpret the results of analyses more intuitively.
Moreover, many common statistics make assumptions about the _distribution_ of our data, so we need to check and test that!

### Example: Sine & Cosine

An illustrative example of why it can be very helpful to _see_ data before making assumptions is the relationship between sine and cosine.
We won't get too mathematical, but just know  they are trigonometric angle functions with a special relationship.
Commonly in psychology, relation = correlation, which assumes a linear relationship. 
However, when we take a look at both the correlation between sine and cosine as well as their relationship represented visually, we might see a problem:

```{r exsincos, echo = F, fig.height=4}
x <- sin(1:500)
y <- cos(1:500)

cos <- ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x = 1:50, y = y[1:50]))+
  theme_apa() +
  labs(title = "Cosine Alone", x = "Time", y = "Cosine")
sico <- ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x, y))+
  theme_apa()+
  labs(x = "Sine", # y = "Cosine",
       title = paste("Correlation =", round(cor(x,y), 3))) + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank())

cowplot::plot_grid(cos, sico, nrow = 1)
```

We can see that the two variables clearly have a certain type of relation with each other which is definitely not linear.
But if we only reported the very very small correlation of .001, one could assume they had no relation at all! 
Keeping that in mind, let's see how we can create beautiful and concise visualizations in R!

## What is `ggplot2`?

First off, it is probably the best data visualization package in R.
Like `dplyr` it is part of the `tidyverse`, so you can expect fairly intuitively named functions and a clear structure that you can build up as you go. <i>&hearts;</i>
If you have not yet installed the whole `tidyverse`, you can install `ggplot2` individually with `install.packages("ggplot2")`.
Once installed, you can load it with `library(ggplot2)`.

With `ggplot2` you can build your plots layer by layer.
Here you can see a schematic of the different elements that can be added to any plot:

![](./img/ggplot2layers.png)
<figcaption style = "font-size: 7pt;">[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html){target="_blank"}</figcaption>

There are two main functions, or rather types of function in this package.

### `ggplot()` {-}

This is the main function for "opening the canvas", so it basically prepares R for the plot definition.
Commonly, we define the data set (the _Data_ layer of the schematic) and which variables to plot in this function (the _Mapping_ layer).
The mapping needs the _aesthetics_ function `aes()` as input, in which the variable(s) to be plotted will be defined.

> <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb" style="color: #a34c21;"></i><i style="color: #a34c21;">It's important to remember that the package is
called _ggplot**2**_ while the function call is _ggplot_!</i>
    
### `geom_XYZ()` {-}

- Defines the actual type of plot = _geometric objects_
- When data is pre-defined, this function does not _need_ additional input
- Can handle some "pretty makers", such as `alpha`, which defines color opacity
- _geom_bar, geom_boxplot, geom_density, geom_jitter, geom_histogram_
    
<!-- ## First example <i> &#127800;</i> -->

<!-- ```{r echo = F} -->
<!-- p <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Width)) -->
<!-- cowplot::plot_grid( -->
<!--   p + geom_density() + labs(title = "ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Width)) +", subtitle = "geom_density()", caption = ""), -->
<!--   p + geom_bar() + geom_line(stat = 'count') + labs(title = "", subtitle = "geom_bar() + geom_line()*", caption = "*geom_line(stat = 'count')") -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->
    
## Your First Bar Plot

```{r fbarplot, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=8, fig.align='left'}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width)) 
```

### Making Plots Prettier

- color
    - visual property of the geometric object
    - which color for the outlines
    - `colors()`
- fill
    - visual property of the geometric object
    - which color to fill
- labs
- theme
    - `install.packages("papaja")` $\rightarrow$ `library(papaja)`

### Example: Bar Plot with color and fill

```{r bpcf, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=8, fig.align='left'}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width), color = "deepskyblue3", fill = "deepskyblue")
```

> <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb" style="color: yellow;"></i> What could cause this distribution?



```{r bpcf2, fig.height=4.5,  fig.width=9.15, fig.align='left'}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width, color = Species, fill = Species))
```

> <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb" style="color: yellow;"></i> What do you notice about the code compared to before?

## Static vs. Dynamic Aesthetics

- **Static Aesthetics**: Fixed values applied to all elements of the plot
    - Example: _color = "deepskyblue3"_
    - Means every element will have the same color.
- **Dynamic Aesthetics**: These map a variable in your data to an aesthetic, which allows different elements to have different colors based on the data
    - Example: _aes(color = Species)_
    - Means the color will vary according to the Species variable in the data set.
    
### Exercise

<br>

Create a **density plot** that shows _Sepal.Length_ from the `iris` data set. <br>
_Fill_ in the color depending on the Species and _color_ the outlines with "white". <br>
Make sure everything is visible and legible, so try to use an _alpha_ of around 0.6.

```{r exyz, eval = F}
ggplot(data) + 
  geom_XYZ(aes(), alpha = ?)
```

### Solution

```{r solxyz, fig.height=4.5,  fig.width=9.15, fig.align='left'}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species), 
               color = "white", alpha = .6)
```

## Adding labels and themes

- A good plot should be self explanatory and clear
- We need labels to tell others what our plot shows
    - Especially when using color for another variable, it needs to be clear what each color means
- Also the gray-ish default background is ok, but neither very pretty nor very clear
    - It is sometimes advisable to keep grid lines visible, but sometimes they can be distracting and unnecessary
    - ggplot2 has a lot of built-in theme options, but there are many packages that provide their own themes
    - Usually _my preference_ is `papaja::theme_apa()`, which adheres to APA guidelines
    
    

```{r themeslabels, fig.height=3.5,  fig.width=9.15, fig.align='left'}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width, color = Species, fill = Species)) +
  theme_apa() +
  labs(x = "Petal Width", y = "Flower Count",
       title = "Size of Iris Flowers")
```

## Bivariate Visualizations

- The bar plot shows the distribution of a single variable
    - We can add color to show groups
- Showing the relationship of two variables to each other is crucial for understanding our data
    - We can still add color to make existing groups clearer or add a third variable
- For a broad overview of which visualization (and statistic) to use for which type of data, visit the [Statistics Picker](https://the-tave.shinyapps.io/Statistik-Picker/){target="_blank"} (currently only available in German)
    - Most common are boxplots, scatterplots & line graphs
    
### Boxplot Example

As suggested by one of you, we will look at the relationship of preferred music genre and music volume in our course:

```{r boxex, fig.height=2.6,  fig.width=9.15}
# seminar <- readRDS("./data/seminar_data.Rds")
ggplot(seminar, aes(x=v07_genre, y=v08_loudness, colour=v07_genre, fill=v07_genre)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) + theme_apa() +
  labs(x = "Preferred Music Genre", y = "Loudness (arbitrary units)", 
       color = "Genre", fill = "Genre")
```


### Exercise: Boxplot

Create a **box plot** that shows _Sepal.Length_ from the `iris` data set grouped by the _Species_. <br>
_Fill_ and _color_ depending on the Species. <br>
Make sure everything is visible and legible, so try to use an _alpha_ of around 0.7. <br>
Try to add _labels_ and a _theme_. 

`r hide()`

```{r bpsol, fig.height=4.5,  fig.width=9.15, fig.align='left'}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length,
                   color = Species, fill = Species), alpha = .6) +
  theme_minimal() + labs(x = "Species", y = "Sepal Length")
```

`r unhide()`

### Inspiration: colors and palettes

- These plots have all used the default colors from ggplot2
- There are many options for customization, either:
    - Use the "brewer" palettes from `ggplot2` with `scale_color_brewer()` or `scale_fill_brewer()`
    - Choose single colors (static aesthetics), check `colors()` for R color names
    - Create a color palette with all colors that you need and use it with `scale_color_manual()` or `scale_fill_manual()`
    - Use a predefined color palette from packages like `viridis` or `unikn` or `RColorBrewer`...
- Have fun with it! 

```{r inspo, echo = F, fig.height=5,  fig.width=10}
boxy <- ggplot(seminar, aes(x = v07_genre, y = v08_loudness, colour = v07_genre, fill = v07_genre)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_apa() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

cowplot::plot_grid(boxy + scale_color_brewer() + scale_fill_brewer() + 
                     labs(x = "", y = "Preferred Music Volume (arbitrary units)", title = "brewer"),
                   boxy + scale_color_viridis_d(option = "inferno") + scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "inferno") + 
                     labs(x = "Preferred Music Genre", y = "", title = "viridis"),
                   boxy + scale_color_manual(values = c("#900C3F", "#1D3557", "#FF5733")) + 
                     scale_fill_manual(values = c("#900C3F", "#1D3557", "#FF5733")) +
                     labs(x="", y="", title = "manual"),
                   nrow = 1)
```
